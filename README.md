# Sinhala_Spell_And_Grammer_Checker
This repository implements a comprehensive solution for spell checking and grammar checking in the Sinhala language. Our approach integrates rule-based methods alongside machine learning models to address the unique challenges of Sinhala language processing.

Features

Spell Checker:

Implemented using a rule-based method tailored for Sinhala spell correction.

Grammar Checker:

Rule-Based Method: Incorporates handcrafted rules to identify and correct grammatical errors in Sinhala.

Machine Learning Models: Evaluated three different architectures for Sinhala grammar checking:

Regression Model

Unidirectional LSTM

Bidirectional LSTM

Dataset:

Contains annotated data for training and evaluation of grammar checking models.

Evaluation:

Comparative analysis of the three machine learning models to identify the best architecture for Sinhala grammar checking.
