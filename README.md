# Sinhala_Spell_And_Grammar_Checker

This repository implements a comprehensive solution for spell checking and grammar checking in the Sinhala language. Our approach integrates rule-based methods alongside machine learning models to address the unique challenges of Sinhala language processing.

## Features

### Spell Checker:
- Implemented using a rule-based method tailored for Sinhala spell correction.

### Grammar Checker:
- **Rule-Based Method:** Incorporates handcrafted rules to identify and correct grammatical errors in Sinhala.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Evaluated three different architectures for Sinhala grammar checking:
  - Regression Model
  - Unidirectional LSTM
  - Bidirectional LSTM

## Dataset:
- Contains annotated data for training and evaluation of grammar checking models.

## Evaluation:
- Comparative analysis of the three machine learning models to identify the best architecture for Sinhala grammar checking.

## Output Demo:
Here are some sample outputs of the spell checker and grammar checker in action:
